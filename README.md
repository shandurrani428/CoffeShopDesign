# **Coffee Shop React Native Project**
This repository contains a React Native project for a Coffee Shop application. The application consists of four screens: Get Started, Home, Coffee Detail, and Order Detail.

## **Get Started Screen**
The Get Started screen serves as the entry point for the application. It provides a brief introduction and encourages users to explore the coffee options available in the app.

## **Home Screen**
The Home screen is where users can choose their desired coffee. It provides a search functionality to easily find specific coffee items. Users can also filter the available coffees based on their category name, making it convenient to browse through various options.

## **Coffee Detail Screen**
The Coffee Detail screen displays detailed information about a specific coffee item. Users can view its description, ingredients, and any additional details provided. They can also place an order for the coffee directly from this screen.

## **Order Detail Screen**
Once a coffee is ordered, users are navigated to the Order Detail screen. This screen confirms that the order has been successfully placed, providing a message or notification to indicate the successful placement of the order.
